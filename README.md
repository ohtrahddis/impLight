#ImpLight
Control a light with your voice!

## About
### ImpLight takes uses the Electric Imp to control a lamp with your voice. 
A simple transistor circuit controls current flowing through the lamp, and is activated by "on" and "off" commands from the imp Agent.
Voice control is added using Chrome's speech recognition for webkit browsers, so a simple html page makes GET requests to the imp's device URL.

The circuitry can be changed to fit a variety of devices. Initially an AC powered room lamp with a relay circuit was planned for demonstration, but technical difficulties and possible hazards
insisted on a simpler approach with a battery powered lamp as a proof of concept.
